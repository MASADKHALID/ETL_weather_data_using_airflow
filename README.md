#** WeatherFlow ETL Pipeline: Automating Weather Data Collection and Transformation**
**Project Introduction**
Weather is a critical factor influencing industries such as agriculture, logistics, and energy. The WeatherFlow ETL Pipeline automates the process of gathering, processing, and storing weather data for Karachi. By leveraging the OpenWeather API, AWS services, and Apache Airflow, this project offers a scalable and efficient solution for weather data management.

# **Key Features**
**1. Seamless API Integration**
The pipeline connects to the OpenWeather API to extract detailed weather data, including temperature, humidity, and wind conditions for Karachi.

**2. Secure Cloud Storage**
AWS S3 is used to store transformed data, ensuring secure, reliable, and scalable access.

**3. Automated Orchestration**
Apache Airflow manages the pipeline, orchestrating each ETL step from API extraction to S3 storage.

#**Project Workflow**
# **Phase 1: Setup**
AWS EC2 Instance: Launch an EC2 instance to host Apache Airflow, which serves as the orchestration engine.

**Access Keys Configuration:**

Generate Access Key ID, Secret Access Key, and Session Token using AWS IAM.
Configure these credentials in the EC2 instance to allow interaction with AWS services like S3.
Use aws configure to securely set up the access keys.
**S3 Bucket Creation:**

**Create an S3 bucket to store processed weather data.**
Configure appropriate permissions to enable the EC2 instance to write data to the bucket.

# **Phase 2: ETL Pipeline Tasks**
The Airflow DAG orchestrates the following tasks:

**Weather API Ready:** 
  Establishes a connection to the OpenWeather API using the API key and validates access.
**Extract Weather Data: **
  Collects real-time weather data for Karachi.
**Transform and Load Data:**
  Cleans and processes the data before storing it in the S3 bucket.

# **Phase 3: Automating and Triggering the Pipeline**
The pipeline runs on a predefined schedule in Airflow, ensuring regular updates of weather data.
The S3 bucket acts as a central repository, accessible for analysis or downstream applications.



The WeatherFlow ETL Pipeline simplifies the complexities of weather data management through automation, secure cloud integration, and efficient task orchestration. This pipeline is not only a step towards operational excellence but also a foundation for building predictive analytics and intelligent weather-dependent solutions.
