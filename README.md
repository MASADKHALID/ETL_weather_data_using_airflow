# ETL_weather_data_using_airflow
In this project, weather data is fetched from the OpenWeather API and processed through an ETL pipeline. Apache Airflow is used for task scheduling and orchestration, ensuring efficient automation of workflows. The processed data is stored in an Amazon S3 bucket for scalable and secure storage, ready for further analysis or integration.
